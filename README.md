# SDLC

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?

To interpret user needs, I have to have an understanding of what these needs are. Once I understand what the user wants to accomplish, I can begin developing the software to meet the specific requirements. This can be achieved by creating "user stories" that identify specific tasks/objectives that the software being developed should be able to do and also help to identify a definition of done for each of the tasks/objectives. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Before beginning to develop programs I have to consider what is trying to be accomplished by the program. I have to think about how much flexibility and adaptability can be afforded,  along with the various constraints the project may have. This helps me know what approach to the SDLC I should take, specifically wether or not it should be an agile project or is it the type of project a waterfall approach may be necessary. After having completed this course I have a much better understanding of the SDLC and how beneficial implementing an agile team and its processes/practices can be. I certainly wish to incorporate agile's practices, from how a team should be built, all the way to finish by incorporating sprint reviews and retrospectives. I think following the agile manifesto is key when implementing agile practices, which helps ensure a better product is delivered to clients and faster.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I believe to be a good team member in software development an individual must be engaging. A good team member consistently produces work that benefits the team as a whole and strives to complete assigned tasks/requirements promptly. If a team member has problems they need to communicate their problems quickly so that a solution can be found. A good team member practices openness and transparency so that no "illusion of progress" is ever made and that true progress is achieved. Communication is extremely important and holding oneself accountable to one's responsibilities helps drive a team forward, and when needed, holds other team members accountable as well.
